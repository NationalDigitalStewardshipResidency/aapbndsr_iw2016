# Reading key A/V metadata

The following information is related to the _NDSR 2016 Immersion Week - Automating Procedures for Digital Asset Management_ presentation also found in this GitHub repository. 

## Overview

This page focuses on getting comfortable using two common tools - [MediaInfo](http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) and [ffprobe](http://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) - for basic metadata tasks related to audiovisual archiving and preservation. 


## Getting started

1. Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal). 

2. Download the sample materials for this exercise (av-metadata-samples.zip). Use `mv` to move the zip file to your Desktop. Then use `unzip` to unpackage it into a directory (see [cli-basics](cli-basics.md) for a refresher on how to do this). 

3. You should already have MediaInfo and ffprobe installed. Check this by trying to look at the documentation:

            `mediainfo`


            `man ffprobe`

If you do not have either of these tools installed, follow directions to [install ffmpeg/ffprobe](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/MacOSX) and [install MediaInfo](http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download). If you are using Homebrew (which is great, simple to use package installer for Mac), you can simply type:

            `brew install ffmpeg`

            and

            `brew install media-info`
