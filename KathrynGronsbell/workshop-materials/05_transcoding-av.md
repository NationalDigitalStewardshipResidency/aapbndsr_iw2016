# Transcoding A/V for preservation and access

The following information is related to the _NDSR 2016 Immersion Week - Automating Procedures for Digital Asset Management_ presentation also found in this GitHub repository. 

## Overview

This page will not tell you how, when, or why to transcode audiovisual material for preservation and access. Requirements and decisions around transcoding should be informed by assessment, prioritization, and the resulting policies. The following information should be used to gain comfort using the command line to transcode or otherwise modify audiovisual files and metadata - the activities and tasks below do not represent best practices, but they do represent a cross-section of realistic practices. 

Below are recommendations to explore [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) through the CLI with significant support from [ffmprovisr](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/), an open source web app that provides common ffmpeg commands and information so that even a novice user can understand what the command syntax means and what it does.
