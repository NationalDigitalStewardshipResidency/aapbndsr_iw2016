# Reading key A/V metadata

The following information is related to the _NDSR 2016 Immersion Week - Automating Procedures for Digital Asset Management_ presentation also found in this GitHub repository. 

## Overview

The activities and discussion points below provide an overview of the scenarios where adding, deleting, or modifying metadata in audiovisual files might take place. 


## Getting started

The first question we need to address is: *why are you trying to modify metadata?*

For this workshop, we will be working with individual test files, which is less likely to be the best way forward at your residencies. Hopefully, any writing of metadata would be done by batch (preferably scripted or using an existing tool) as part of a workflow dictated by policy.


### DISCUSSION: Sharing metadata modification scenarios

1. Individually, brainstorm scenarios where you might need to *intervene and modify technical, descriptive, or administrative metadata*.

2. Document these scenarios as use cases, using this format:

    _As a_ [ROLE], _I need_ [REQUIREMENT] _so that_ [BENEFIT].

For example, a use case for modifying metadata might be:

_As an archivist, I need to embed my institution's copyright notice into all access derivatives of our Video Collection so that when these access derivatives are released to the public, users will see the rights information for each file they are interested in using._


### ACTIVITY: Add descriptive metadata to A/V files
